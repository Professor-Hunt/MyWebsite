Students will create a relational\r\ndatabase with SQLite and use SQL query language to interact within this\r\ndatabase. They will also connect this database with R statistical\r\nsoftware. Students will use R statistical software for ETL.\r\nSpecifically, R and RStudio (GUI for R) will be used in conjunction with\r\nTidyverse R packages for basic data manipulation and visualizations.\r\nUsing R forces students to use critical thinking in order to program and\r\ntrouble shoot errors. Students will also learn Markdown which is a\r\nframework for presenting interactive reports will rich visuals. This\r\nwill help students learn the value of presenting information in a\r\nbusiness analytics context. Excel will be used to compare and contrast R\r\nand SQL programming. Students will perform advanced Excel tasks such as,\r\nbut not limited to, pivot tables, vlookup, nested formulas, and\r\ndashboard creation.\r\nACC 3053\r\nLINK\r\nSample Final Projects\r\nJustin Goolsby\r\n\r\n  \r\nJustin‚Äôs Final\r\nProject\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMcKenzie Chambley\r\n\r\n  \r\nMcKenzie‚Äôs Final\r\nProject\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChad Arthur\r\n\r\n  \r\nChad‚Äôs Final Project\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nACC 8143\r\nAccounting Data Analytics\r\nStudents will use R statistical software for ETL (extraction,\r\ntransformation, and loading data). Specifically, R and RStudio (GUI for\r\nR) will be used in conjunction with Tidyverse R packages for advanced\r\nmanipulation and visualizations. Students will learn to use Git and\r\nGitHub. Git and GitHub are extensively used for data analytics in\r\npractice. GitHub will show the students the importance of version\r\ncontrol and the value of coding with care. Students will also learn\r\nMarkdown which is a framework for presenting interactive reports,\r\ndashboards, and creating websites. Students will use RStudio, GitHub,\r\nMarkdown, and Distill r package to make a professional website for\r\nshowcasing their work in the class. This will help students learn the\r\nvalue of presenting information in a business analytics context and\r\npresenting their own work for others to see. Using Rstudio the students\r\nwill learn how popular machine learning algorithms work, the difference\r\nbetween parametric and nonparametric algorithms, supervised and\r\nunsupervised algorithms, the bias-variance trade-off, and overfitting\r\nand underfitting algorithms with hands on examples in business\r\ncontexts.\r\nACC 8143\r\nLINK\r\nSample Final Projects\r\nKaris Cox\r\n\r\n  \r\nKaris‚Äôs\r\nWebsite\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMatthew Ferris\r\n\r\n  \r\nMatthew‚Äôs\r\nWebsite\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSiwei Jiang\r\n\r\n  \r\nSiwei‚Äôs\r\nWebsite\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
