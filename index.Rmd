# General Info

I am an adjunct instructor at [Louisiana Tech University](https://business.latech.edu/undergraduate-programs/accounting/) in the accounting department. I teach a management accounting course, which is transitioning to include more data analytics. I am married with two boys (3 and 1.5) and I love it 😄 .
